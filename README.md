My JavaScript solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016).

## Installation and setup

```
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Add a line to the file with `COOKIE=""` that contains the cookies from the website inside the parenthesis.

## Run solution

```

Nodemon will automatically re-run a solution when files change. `Ctrl + C` to quit.
